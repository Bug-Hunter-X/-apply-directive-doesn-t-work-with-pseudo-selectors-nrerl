This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector (like `hover`, `focus`, etc.). The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply the styles to the pseudo-selector. For example:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:@apply bg-blue-700">
  Click me
</button>
```

In this case, the `bg-blue-700` class will not be applied when hovering over the button. This is because `@apply` only applies the base styles, not the pseudo-selector styles.
